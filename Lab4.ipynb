    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Database Management System (DBMS)\n",
    "A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. It provides an organized method to store large volumes of data and enables efficient retrieval, insertion, deletion, and updating of information. DBMS plays a crucial role in reducing data redundancy and maintaining data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, DBMS ensures data security, integrity, concurrency control, and backup and recovery mechanisms. By separating data from application logic, DBMS makes applications more flexible and scalable. Examples of DBMS include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Relational Databases\n",
    "Relational databases organize data into tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents an entity, and each row represents a unique record. Relationships between tables are established using primary keys and foreign keys, ensuring logical connections between related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to define, manipulate, and query relational databases. Relational databases are known for their strong consistency, data integrity constraints, and suitability for structured data. They are widely used in banking, education systems, and enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. SQLite\n",
    "SQLite is a lightweight, serverless relational database engine that stores the entire database in a single file. It requires minimal configuration and is embedded directly into applications, making it ideal for small to medium-scale projects, desktop software, and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, SQLite supports standard SQL features, transactions, and ACID properties. It is highly reliable and efficient for applications that require local data storage without the overhead of a full database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. SQLAlchemy ORM\n",
    "SQLAlchemy is a Python library that provides a powerful toolkit for working with relational databases. It includes an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows developers to map database tables to Python classes, enabling interaction with databases using object-oriented programming principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using SQLAlchemy, developers can avoid writing complex SQL queries directly and instead work with Python objects. This improves code readability, enhances security by preventing SQL injection attacks, and allows applications to switch between different database engines with minimal changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. NoSQL Databases\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike relational databases, they do not rely on fixed schemas or table-based structures, making them highly flexible and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "These databases are optimized for high performance, distributed storage, and real-time applications. NoSQL databases are commonly used in big data applications, content management systems, and cloud-based services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. MongoDB\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like BSON documents. Data is organized into collections, and each document can have a different structure, allowing dynamic and flexible data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports high availability, horizontal scaling, and efficient querying of hierarchical data. It is widely used in modern web applications, real-time analytics, and applications where data structures frequently evolve."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "This lab illustrates how different database paradigms can be effectively implemented using Python. SQLite demonstrates traditional relational database operations using SQL, while SQLAlchemy ORM simplifies database interaction through object-oriented abstractions. MongoDB highlights the advantages of schema-less document storage, offering flexibility and scalability. Understanding these approaches helps developers select suitable database technologies based on application needs."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this experiment, both relational and non-relational database systems were successfully explored using Python. SQLite and SQLAlchemy provided structured and secure data management, whereas MongoDB enabled flexible handling of unstructured data.
